My function is online payment. 
In there I created 2 services: Card Service and Payment Service.
First customer selects to pay the bill.
While making the payment customer can save card details separately. 
So, customer can save multiple accounts detail on his profile.
Customer can update and delete those card details.
Specially customer can’t save cvv number and expiration date of the cards. 
If customer wish to not to save card details, customer can proceed with making the payment without saving any card details. 
If customer has saved any accounts for make the payment, customer can select those accounts while entering details to make the payment. 
Anyone can’t enter same account no with various customer numbers: account number is unique.
Only customer can add, update, delete and see the their card details. And admin can view all the cards.
